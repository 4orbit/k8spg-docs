# *Percona Operator for PostgreSQL* 1.4.0

* **Date**

    March 23, 2023

* **Installation**

    [Percona Operator for PostgreSQL](../index.md#installation-guides)

## Release Highlights

* The [affinity and anti-affinity](../constraints.md#affinity-and-anti-affinity) rules can now be configured for backup Pods in addition to Primary and Replicas

* It is now possible to customize [pgBackRest parameters](https://pgbackrest.org/configuration.html) for scheduled backups in the dedicated Custom Resource option

## Improvements

* {{ k8spgjira(188) }}: Add Custom Resource options to set static IP-address for the pgPrimary, pgReplicas, and pgBouncer LoadBalancers

* {{ k8spgjira(269) }}: It is now possible to define affinity and anti-affinity rules for backup Pods

* {{ k8spgjira(270) }}: The new `schedule.backrestOpts` Custom Resource option allows to customize pgBackRest parameters for scheduled backups

* {{ k8spgjira(292) }}: The Operator now uses units based on the power of 2 (e.g. `GiB` instead of `G`) for the storage size, to make it multiple of the 1024 default kernel block size (thanks to Rodney Karemba for contribution)

* {{ k8spgjira(293) }}: Get rid of ansible-galaxy install inside pgo-deployer entrypoint **NOTHING TO END-USER**

## Bugs Fixed

* {{ k8spgjira(286) }}: Fix a bug which caused PMM client connection fail when requiring TLS for all connections was set by the `TLSOnly` Custom Resource option

* {{ k8spgjira(290) }}: Fix a bug due to which ssh connection used for backups and new replica creation could hang if exceeding the PostgreSQL 60 seconds timeout (e.g. because of network problems); to avoid such orphaned connections, gbackrest archive-push command is now automatically killed after timeout

* {{ k8spgjira(291) }}: Fix a bug which prevented backup schedule in the Custom Resource to be updated  without deleting the existing schedule first and recreating it as a new one

## Supported platforms

The following platforms were tested and are officially supported by the Operator
1.4.0:


* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) 1.21 - 1.24

* [Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com) 1.20 - 1.22

* [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) 4.7 - 4.10

This list only includes the platforms that the Percona Operators are specifically tested on as part of the release process. Other Kubernetes flavors and versions depend on the backward compatibility offered by Kubernetes itself.
