    [Installing Percona Operator for PostgreSQL](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-postgresql/2.0/index.html#installation-guide) 


The Percona Operator is based on best practices for configuration and setup of
a [Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL on Kubernetes](https://www.percona.com/doc/postgresql/LATEST/index.html).
The benefits of the Operator are many, but saving time and delivering a
consistent and vetted environment is key.

!!! note

    Version 2.1.0 of the Percona Operator for PostgreSQL is a **tech preview release** and it is **not recommended for production environments.**
    As of today, we recommend using [Percona Operator for PostgreSQL 1.x](https://www.percona.com/https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/index.html), which is production-ready and contains everything you need to quickly and consistently deploy and scale PostgreSQL clusters in a Kubernetes-based environment, on-premises or in the cloud.

The *Percona Operator for PostgreSQL 2.x* is based on the 5.x branch of the [Postgres Operator developed by Crunchy Data](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/). Please see the main changes in this version below.

## Release Highlights

* The [automated upgrade](../update.md#automatic-upgrade) is now disabled by default to prevent an unplanned downtimes for user applications and to provide defaults more focused on strict userâ€™s control over the cluster

* [Flexible anti-affinity configuration](../constraints.md) is now available, which allows the Operator to isolate PostgreSQL cluster instances on different Kubernetes nodes or to increase its availability by placing PostgreSQL instances in different availability zones
