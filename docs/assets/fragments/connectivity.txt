1. You will need the user login and password to access the cluster. The Operator
    automatically creates such a user by default with the login name is which
    copies the the cluster name. User passwords is stored in the Secrets objects
    named as `<cluster_name>-pguser-<user_name>`.

    Use `kubectl get secrets` command to see the list of Secrets objects. By
    default the Secrets object you are interested in has
    `cluster1-pguser-cluster1` name. You can use the following command to get
    the password of this user:
    
    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl get secret cluster1-pguser-cluster1 --template='{{.data.password | base64decode}}{{"\n"}}'
    ```

2. Run a container with `psql` tool and connect its console output to your
    terminal. The following command will do this, naming the new Pod
    `pg-client`:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" data-prompt-second="[postgres@pg-client /]$"}
    $ kubectl run -i --rm --tty pg-client --image=perconalab/percona-distribution-postgresql:{{ postgresrecommended }} --restart=Never -- bash -il
    [postgres@pg-client /]$ PGPASSWORD='pguser_password' psql -h cluster1-pgbouncer.postgres-operator.svc -p 5432 -U cluster1 cluster1
    ```

    Executing it may require some time to deploy the correspondent Pod.

    This command will connect you as a `cluster1` user to a `cluster1` database
    via the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" data-prompt-second="pgdb=>"}
    psql ({{ postgresrecommended }})
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.
    pgdb=>
    ```
