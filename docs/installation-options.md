# The Operator installation options

When installing The Operator, you can customize additional configuration options. These options are specified in `deploy/operator.yaml` file and already have reasonable defaults, so most users have no need modifying them.

!!! note

    The  sets The Pod anti-affinity can be set for all of the Pods that are managed by the Operator in a PostgreSQL cluster with the `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY` label. By default, the pgBackRest and pgBouncer Pods inherit the value of `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY`; user can override this behavior by setting the `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY_PGBACKREST` and/or `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY_PGBOUNCER` variables for pgBackRest and pgBouncer respectively.

## Storage Settings

Options defined in this section can be used to specify the storage configurations used by the Operator.

### Storage Configuration Options

Kubernetes and OpenShift offer support for a wide variety of different storage types and we provide suggested configurations for different environments. These storage types can be modified or removed as needed, while additional storage configurations can also be added to meet the specific storage requirements for your PostgreSQL clusters.
The following storage variables are used to add or modify operator storage configurations at installation:

| Name                           | Required           | Description |
|:-------------------------------|:------------------:|:------------|
| storage<ID>_name               | :heavy_check_mark: | The name for the storage configuration |
| storage<ID>_access_mode        | :heavy_check_mark: | The access mode for volumes created with this storage definition |
| storage<ID>_size               | :heavy_check_mark: | The size of the volumes created with this storage definition |
| storage<ID>_class              | Required when using the `dynamic` storage type | The storage class name used when creating dynamic volumes |
| storage<ID>_supplemental_groups| Required when using NFS storage | Supplemental groups that should be added to security contexts on newly created clusters |
| storage<ID>_type               | :heavy_check_mark: | Can be either `create` (the operator will create persistent volumes) or `dynamic` (volumes will be created dynamically by a storage class) |

The ID portion of the storage prefix should be an integer identifier used to group the storage variables into a single configuration.

### PostgreSQL Cluster Storage Defaults

Default storage can be specified for PostgreSQL, pgBackRest, and other elements requiring storage that can outlast the lifetime of a Pod. While the Operator defaults to using `default` to work with the default storage class available in the user's Kubernetes-based environment.

| Name             | Default | Required           | Description |
|:-----------------|:--------|:------------------:|:------------|
| backrest_storage | default | :heavy_check_mark: | The storage configuration used for the pgBackRest repository |
| backup_storage   | default | :heavy_check_mark: | The storage configuration used for backups generated by pg_dump |
| primary_storage  | default | :heavy_check_mark: | The storage configuration used when creating volumes for PostgreSQL primaries on all newly created clusters |
| replica_storage  | default | :heavy_check_mark: | The storage configuration used when creating volumes for PostgreSQL replicas on all newly created clusters |
| wal_storage      | `""`    |                    | The storage configuration used when creating volumes for PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Log |

!!! note

    When using the Operator in a Kubernetes cluster with Nodes that span multiple zones, it is necessary to ensure that all Pods and the Volumes they require are scheduled and provisioned within the same zone. For example, the Volume containing the database files for the primary database in a new PostgreSQL cluster should be provisioned in the same zone as the Node containing the PostgreSQL primary Pod that will be using it.

#### Default StorageClass

| Name                 | Value         |
|:---------------------|:--------------|
| storage1_name        | default       |
| storage1_access_mode | ReadWriteOnce |
| storage1_size        | 1G            |
| storage1_type        | dynamic       |
