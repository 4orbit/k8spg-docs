# Install Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL on Kubernetes

Following steps will allow you to install the Operator and use it to manage
Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL in a Kubernetes-based environment.

1. First of all, clone the percona-postgresql-operator repository:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ git clone -b v{{ release }} https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator
    $ cd percona-postgresql-operator
    ```

    !!! note

    It is crucial to specify the right branch with `-b` option while cloning the
    code on this step. Please be careful.

2. By default deployment will be done in the `default` namespace. If that's not
    the desired one, you can create a new namespace and/or set the context for
    the namespace as follows (replace the `<namespace name>` placeholder with
    some descriptive name):

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl create namespace <namespace name>
    $ kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=<namespace name>
    ```

    Deploy the Operator [using](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/) the following command:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply --server-side  -f deploy/bundle.yaml
    ```

3. After the Operator is started Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL can be
    created at any time with the following command:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml
    ```

    Creation process will take some time. The process is over when both
    Operator and replica set Pods have reached their Running status:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl get pg
    ```

    ??? example "Expected output"

        ```{.text .no-copy}
        NAME       ENDPOINT                     STATUS   POSTGRES   PGBOUNCER   AGE
        cluster1   cluster1-pgbouncer.pgo.svc   ready    3          3           143m
        ```

## Verifying the cluster operation

When creation process is over, `kubectl get pg` command will show you the
cluster status as `ready`, and you can try to connect to the cluster.
